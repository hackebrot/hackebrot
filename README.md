## Hi, I'm Raphael 👨🏻‍💻

I make open-source tools for developers in Python and Go. I'm currently
learning Rust and BigQuery. I also speak at [conferences][talks] and write on
my personal [blog][blog]. I'm also Staff Test Engineer at [Mozilla][mozilla],
a company that makes browsers, apps, code and tools that put people before
profit. 🔥🦊

For fun, I like to run, climb, bicycle, enjoy the outdoors, play video games
and read books. I share my [reading-list][reading-list] on my blog, as I find
it keeps me motivated to read more often. 🏃🏻‍♂️🧗🏻‍♂️🚴🏻‍♂️🌳🌤🎮📚

Ask me about public speaking, coding with Python and automated testing with
[pytest][pytest]. You can follow me on [Twitter][twitter]. 💬
