## Hi, I'm Raphael 👨🏻‍💻

I make open-source tools for developers in Python and Go. I'm currently
learning Rust and BigQuery. I speak at [conferences and meetups][talks] and
write on my [personal blog][blog]. I'm also Staff Test Engineer at
[Mozilla][mozilla], a company that makes browsers, apps, code and tools that
put people before profit. 🔥🦊

For fun, I like to run, climb, ride my bicycle, enjoy the outdoors, play
video games and read books. I share my [reading-list][reading-list] on my
blog, as I find it keeps me motivated to read more often.
🏃🏻‍♂️🧗🏻‍♂️🚴🏻‍♂️🌳🌤🎮📚

I'm interested in mentoring, open-source software communities, and learning
how to become a better tech leader. Ask me about public speaking, coding with
Python and automated testing with [pytest][pytest]. You can follow me on
[Twitter][twitter]. 💬
