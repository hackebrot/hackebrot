## Hi, I'm Raphael! 👨🏻‍💻

I create open-source projects in Python and Go. I'm currently learning Kubernetes
and BigQuery. I speak at [conferences and meetups][talks] and write on my
[personal blog][blog].

I'm also a Staff Software Engineer at [Mozilla][mozilla], a company that makes
browsers, apps, code and tools that puts people before profit. I'm leading an
initiative to move Firefox Services to a Rapid Release Model: We want to foster
a culture of software ownership that empowers services engineers to own the full
lifecycle of their software. 🔥🦊

For fun, I like to run, climb, hike, ride my gravel bike, play video games and
read books. I share my [reading-list][reading-list] on my blog, as I find it
keeps me motivated to read more often. 🏃🏻‍♂️🧗🏻‍♂️🚴🏻‍♂️🌳⛰🌤🎮📚

I'm interested in mentoring, open-source software communities, and learning
how to become a better tech leader. Ask me about public speaking, coding with
Python and automated testing with [pytest][pytest].

You can follow me on [Twitter][twitter]. 💬
